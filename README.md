##  Project Description:
The client desires a system to list their movie showtimes and ticket availability which will be accessible to their patrons to browse selections and make reservations. We plan on using our knowledge of Java to develop an application that can meet the client’s needs. We will utilize the framework systems and models that were provided to us in various labs to serve as a reference for how to best build our software and models.



As mentioned, this project will apply course knowledge of the different forms of software project modeling that has been covered in class which will be used to plan our trajectory and aid us in developing a successful application. Additionally, these models will also allow us to check in with our client before the development process begins, as well as during, to ensure their requirements are being met and our team is interpreting their desired features appropriately. Once our proposal has been accepted by the client, we will tailor our project’s development by picking the software development process and improvement approach that best suits our client’s needs. As a part of this process, we will also divide work up amongst our group members and elect a project manager to facilitate seamless development.



On a final note, we pledge to strictly adhere to the software engineering ethics guidelines discussed in lecture so that we may provide the client with their deliverables in a way that will not compromise the client’s safety, security, or integrity.
